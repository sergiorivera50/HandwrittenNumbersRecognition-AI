# HandwrittenNumbersRecognition-AI
## 3-layer Neural Network for recognizing handwritten numbers from 0 to 9.
Main features (ordered from top to bottom cells):
- 3-Layer Neural Network class
- N-Net Training Algorithm
- N-Net Performance Test
- Own Handwriting Test
- Performance Research*
- Data Plotting

(*): Long cycles of training which have to be manually monitored in order to change the values of the n-net such as learning rates and/or epochs. This process takes a while so I have already done some of the research to be available for the community. This information is plotted inside the Performance Research folder.

# HOW TO SETUP
Step by step:
- Download the repository
- Go to mnist_dataset folder
- Extract the two files
- Go back to the actual Neural Network
- Click neural_net.ipynb
Done!

# HOW TO USE
First you want to define the neural network by running the first cell.
Then you can make use of all the other features by executing the cells you want to test.
(Obviously if you run the Test cell before running the Training cell at least once you will find that the performance is extremely low)
- If you want to do your own performance research with the cell tool that I provide it's fine but I already did that so that you don't have to wait days of training. The plotting is inside the Performance Research folder.
- If you want to try and draw your own number for the AI you just have to edit the digit.png file and execute later the related cell.
