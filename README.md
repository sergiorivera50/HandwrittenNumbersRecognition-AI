# HandwrittenNumbersRecognition-AI
## 3-layer Neural Network for recognizing handwritten numbers from 0 to 9.
Main features (ordered from top to bottom cells):
- 3-Layer Neural Network class
- N-Net Training Algorithm
- N-Net Performance Test
- Own Handwriting Test
- Performance Research*
- Data Plotting

(*): Long cycles of training which have to be manually monitored in order to change the values of the n-net such as learning rates and/or epochs. This process takes a while so I have already done some of the research to be available for the community. This information is plotted inside the Performance Research folder.
